# English Localization Settings
- This submod is a collection of individual settings to customize the English language Monika uses
- There are plenty of options provided to allow Monika to use the English spelling rules you're most used to and/or comfortable with

This submod is compatible with the [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin/releases/latest)! Give it an install to make updating this in the future easy.
